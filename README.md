CENG 491-492 Graduation Project

setup

========

to run the project you need mvn tool.
run "mvn clean install" on java/osgi/ and after installation run java/osgi/laucher/target/launcher-0.1.jar.
if you run the launcher-0.1.jar in the java/osgi/ directory, mvn clean install will also clean the files generated by sling.
otherwise, you should do so manually, in order to see the effect of updates on the bundles.

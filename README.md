CENG 491-492 Graduation Project

setup

========

to run the project you need mvn tool.
run "mvn clean install" on java/osgi/ and after installation run java/osgi/laucher/target/launcher-0.1.jar.
if you run the launcher-0.1.jar in the java/osgi/ directory, mvn clean install will also clean the files generated by sling.
otherwise, you should do so manually, in order to see the effect of updates on the bundles.

to debug run the launcher-0.1.jar with:

java -jar -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=30303,server=y,suspend=n launcher/target/launcher-0.1.jar

command and from eclipse create a remote java application debug configuration with

host:localhost
port:30303

and in the source tab, add the desired java projects.
